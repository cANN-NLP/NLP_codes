I am a Japanese high school student. I came to live in America with my family two weeks ago. One day Mother asked me about my school life. I answered that I enjoyed it very much. But that was not true. I didn't want Mother to worry about me. I always said to myself, \"I live in two worlds, one at home and the other at school. They are very different. At home I speak Japanese and live a happy Japanese life with my family. I feel that school is far away when I am at home. In class at school teachers sometimes speak English so fast that I don't understand them. I want to talk with a friend about that, but I don't have any friends. Every day I wait for a student who will talk to me.\" The next day in art class the teacher stopped at my desk and said, \"Akiko, your picture is very wonderful! \" Then many students came to see my picture. After the art class one girl student came to me. At last a student talked to me! She said, \"Hi, Anne. I'm Suzzan. I would like to talk with you after school.\" I was very happy. I said, \"Yes, of course.\" After school we went to Mary's house and began to talk. Mary was also interested in drawing pictures. We talked about a lot of things. When I talked about my idea of the two worlds, Mary said, \"I didn't know that. But you can ask teachers to speak more slowly. If you want to make your school life happy, you should try to say something to us. We will help you any time.\" I had a very good time with Mary. I ran home to tell Mother about my new friend, but she was not there. Soon Mother came home. \"Mother, where have you been? \"I asked. \"I have been to English school. I began to learn English, \" answered Mother. \"You don't have to learn English so hard because you stay home every day, \" I said. \"I want to make friends to learn about America and tell them a lot about Japan, \" said Mother. \"Mary and Mother have the same idea, \" I thought. \" Today I learned an important thing from Mary and Mother. It is not good to stay in our small world when we are in a foreign culture. I will try hard to make my school life happy.\"\n","Relearning the art of seeing the world around us is quite simple, although it takes practice and requires breaking some bad abits. And \"relearn\" is the correct word. Most of us observed much more as children than we do as adults. A child's day is filled with newness and wonder. The desire to explore, to have an adventure, gave us all a natural ability to be aware of the world around us. \n","But as adults we are slow to be stimulated by new ideas and new situations. We fail to see the wonder of the things around us. The first step in awakening our senses is to rediscover the ability to observe that we had as children. To do so we need to stop anticipating what we are going to see and feel before it happens. Such anticipation blocks our ability to feel. For example, one chilly night I was on a mountain hike with some students. I told them that we were going to have to cross a mountain stream. They began to grumble about how cold it would be. We reached the stream and they reluctantly plunged ahead. They were almost up to their knees in the water when they realized that I had led them into a hot spring. Later they all said that they had felt cold water at first. We also need to notice signs which can help us see more. Once I was on a hike, following about six meters behind my Indian friend named John. As we passed under a huge pine tree. he turned around and said, \"Don't disturb it.\" Surprised, I looked everywhere. Was there a deer, a fox, or something else that I had missed seeing? Finally I looked into the branches of the tree and saw a beautiful owl not three meters from us. I was amazed that Stalking Wolf had known it was there without looking up. When I asked him how he had known the owl was there, he replied, \"Go ask the mice.\" By looking down he had seen the tracks of the mice that had run away from their dreaded enemy, the owl. The next time you take a walk, no matter where it is, open up your eyes. Be aware of all the sights, sounds and sensations. You will be surprised at the many beautiful and interesting things you have been missing.
