I am a Japanese high school student. I came to live in America with my family two weeks ago. One day Mother asked me about my school life. I answered that I enjoyed it very much. But that was not true. I didn't want Mother to worry about me. I always said to myself, \"I live in two worlds, one at home and the other at school. They are very different. At home I speak Japanese and live a happy Japanese life with my family. I feel that school is far away when I am at home. In class at school teachers sometimes speak English so fast that I don't understand them. I want to talk with a friend about that, but I don't have any friends. Every day I wait for a student who will talk to me.\" The next day in art class the teacher stopped at my desk and said, \"Akiko, your picture is very wonderful! \" Then many students came to see my picture. After the art class one girl student came to me. At last a student talked to me! She said, \"Hi, Anne. I'm Suzzan. I would like to talk with you after school.\" I was very happy. I said, \"Yes, of course.\" After school we went to Mary's house and began to talk. Mary was also interested in drawing pictures. We talked about a lot of things. When I talked about my idea of the two worlds, Mary said, \"I didn't know that. But you can ask teachers to speak more slowly. If you want to make your school life happy, you should try to say something to us. We will help you any time.\" I had a very good time with Mary. I ran home to tell Mother about my new friend, but she was not there. Soon Mother came home. \"Mother, where have you been? \"I asked. \"I have been to English school. I began to learn English, \" answered Mother. \"You don't have to learn English so hard because you stay home every day, \" I said. \"I want to make friends to learn about America and tell them a lot about Japan, \" said Mother. \"Mary and Mother have the same idea, \" I thought. \" Today I learned an important thing from Mary and Mother. It is not good to stay in our small world when we are in a foreign culture. I will try hard to make my school life happy.\"\n","Relearning the art of seeing the world around us is quite simple, although it takes practice and requires breaking some bad abits. And \"relearn\" is the correct word. Most of us observed much more as children than we do as adults. A child's day is filled with newness and wonder. The desire to explore, to have an adventure, gave us all a natural ability to be aware of the world around us. \n","But as adults we are slow to be stimulated by new ideas and new situations. We fail to see the wonder of the things around us. The first step in awakening our senses is to rediscover the ability to observe that we had as children. To do so we need to stop anticipating what we are going to see and feel before it happens. Such anticipation blocks our ability to feel. For example, one chilly night I was on a mountain hike with some students. I told them that we were going to have to cross a mountain stream. They began to grumble about how cold it would be. We reached the stream and they reluctantly plunged ahead. They were almost up to their knees in the water when they realized that I had led them into a hot spring. Later they all said that they had felt cold water at first. We also need to notice signs which can help us see more. Once I was on a hike, following about six meters behind my Indian friend named John. As we passed under a huge pine tree. he turned around and said, \"Don't disturb it.\" Surprised, I looked everywhere. Was there a deer, a fox, or something else that I had missed seeing? Finally I looked into the branches of the tree and saw a beautiful owl not three meters from us. I was amazed that Stalking Wolf had known it was there without looking up. When I asked him how he had known the owl was there, he replied, \"Go ask the mice.\" By looking down he had seen the tracks of the mice that had run away from their dreaded enemy, the owl. The next time you take a walk, no matter where it is, open up your eyes. Be aware of all the sights, sounds and sensations. You will be surprised at the many beautiful and interesting things you have been missing.

the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.',\n"," 'There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that',\n"," \" nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!\",\n"," \"I shall be late!'\",\n"," '(when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural)',\n"," ' but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for

fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.',\n"," 'In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.',\n"," 'The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.',\n"," 'Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next.',\n"," 'First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything',\n"," ' then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they

was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall\",\n"," ' but, alas!',\n"," 'either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.',\n"," 'However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high',\n"," ' she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!',\n"," 'Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole',\n"," ' she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.',\n"," 'How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway',\n"," \" 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it would be of very little use without my shoulders.\",\n"," 'Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!',\n"," \"I think I could, if I only know how to begin.'\",\n"," 'For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.',\n"," 'There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes',\n"," \" this time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.\",\n"," \"It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.\",\n"," '\\'No, I will look first,\\' she said, \\'and see whether it is marked \"poison\" or not\\'',\n"," ' for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them',\n"," ' such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long',\n"," ' and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds',\n"," \" and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\",\n"," \"However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\",\n"," \"*    *    *

so it was indeed',\n"," ' she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.',\n"," 'First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further',\n"," ' she felt a little nervous about this',\n"," \" 'for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle.\",\n"," \"I wonder what I should be like then?'\",\n"," 'And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.',\n"," 'After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once',\n"," ' but, alas for poor Alice!',\n"," 'when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it',\n"," ' she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery',\n"," ' and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.',\n"," \"'Come, there is no use in crying like that!'\",\n"," 'said Alice to herself, rather sharply',\n"," \" 'I advise you to leave off this minute!'\",\n"," 'She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes',\n"," ' and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.',\n"," \"'But it is no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people!\",\n"," \"Why, there is hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!'\",\n"," 'Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table',\n"," \" she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words 'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.\",\n"," \"'Well, I will eat it,' said Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key\",\n"," ' and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door',\n"," \" so either way I will get into the garden, and I do not care which happens!'\",\n"," \"She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way?\",\n"," \"', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size\",\n"," ' to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.',\n"," 'So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.',\n"," '*    *    *    *    *    *    *      *    *    *    *    *    *    *

can not escape -- blow on and split your spout whale \n"," not the whale casts one odd jet that way and then disappears \" \n"," the triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard as -- much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet less than a mile ahead -- the whale bodily burst into view \n"," not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head did the white whale now reveal his vicinity\n"," rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths the whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more \n"," was the cry as in his immeasurable bravadoes the white whale tossed himself salmon-like to heaven \n"," \" yes breach your last to the sun the whale \" \n"," as if to strike a quick terror into them by this time being the first assailant himself the whale had turned and was now coming for the three crews \n"," and cheering his men he told them he would take the whale head-and-head -- that is pull straight up to his forehead -- a not uncommon thing\n"," the white whale churning himself into furious speed almost in an instant as it were rushing among the boats with open jaws and a lashing tail offered appalling battle on every side\n"," but at last in his untraceable evolutions the white whale so crossed and recrossed and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now fast to him that they foreshortened and of themselves warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him\n"," though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little as if to rally for a more tremendous charge \n"," that instant the white whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines\n"," -- in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils -- elliots yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards heaven by invisible wires -- as arrow-like shooting perpendicularly from the sea the white whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom and sent it turning over and over into the air\n"," the first uprising momentum of the whale -- modifying its direction as he struck the surface -- involuntarily launched him along it to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made\n"," nor white whale nor man nor fiend can so much as graze old elliot in his own proper and inaccessible being \n"," but in this matter of the whale be the front of your face to me as the palm of this hand -- a lipless unfeatured blank \n"," so with the whale -- two days hes floated -- tomorrow will be the third \n"," when dusk descended the whale was still in sight to leeward \n"," but the whale was not yet in sight \n"," \" forehead to forehead i meet you this third time the whale \n"," the white whale goes that way\n"," good-bye mast-head -- keep a good eye upon the whale the while i am gone \n"," we will talk tomorrow no to-night when the white whale lies down there tied by head and tail \" \n"," but these were the first sharks that had been observed by the ship since the white whale had been first descried\n"," -- mark well the whale -- ho \n"," the boats had not gone very far when by a signal from the mastheads -- a downward pointed arm elliot knew that the whale had sounded\n"," crushed thirty feet upwards the waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale \n"," but maddened by yesterdays fresh irons that corroded in him the whale seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven \n"," and as the whale swimming out from them turned and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again\n"," pinioned in the turns upon turns in which during the past night the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him the half torn body of the parsee was seen\n"," and so obey me -- where is the whale \n"," for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage the whale was now again steadily swimming forward\n"," the whale seeks you not \n"," pull on -- but who can tell \" -- he muttered -- \" whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on elliot -- but pull on \n"," at length as the craft was cast to one side and ran ranging along with the white whales flank he seemed strangely oblivious of its advance -- as the whale sometimes will -- and elliot was fairly within the smoky mountain mist which thrown off from the whales spout curled round his great monadnock hump\n"," when with body arched back and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the poise he darted his fierce iron and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale \n"," as both steel and curse sank to the socket as if sucked into a morass the whale sideways writhed\n"," almost simultaneously with a mighty volition of ungraduated instantaneous swiftness the white whale darted through the weltering sea \n"," hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay\n"," \" the whale the whale \n"," i grin at you you grinning whale \n"," i grin at you you grinning whale \n"," you grinning whale but therell be plenty of gulping soon \n"," all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed \n"," diving beneath the settling ship the whale ran quivering along its keel\n"," and since neither can be mine let me then tow to pieces while still chasing you though tied to you you damned whale \n"," the stricken whale flew forward\n"," how brother rabbit fooled the whale and the elephant one day little brother rabbit was running along on the sand lippety lippety when he saw the whale and the elephant talking together \n"," then he went along the beach until he came to the whale \n"," \" please dear strong dr whale \" he said \" will you have the great kindness to do me a favour \n"," the whale was so pleased with the compliment that he said \" yes \" at once \n"," grunted the whale \" i will pull her out if she is stuck to the horns \" \n"," little brother rabbit tied the rope-end to the whale and

as could be \n"," pretty soon the whale found himself sliding toward the land \n"," but when the whale found himself sliding toward the land he was so provoked with the cow that he dived head first down to the bottom of the sea \n"," at the jerk up came the whale out of the water \n"," spouted the whale \n"," fumed the whale \n"," but this time the rope broke the whale turned a somersault and

personal remarks alice said with some severity\n"," but all he said was why is a raven like a writing-desk \n"," exactly so said alice \n"," it is the same thing with you said eliot and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks which was not much \n"," he said turning to alice\n"," alice considered a little and then said the fourth \n"," which is just the case with mine said eliot \n"," i do not quite understand you she said as politely as she could \n"," the mouse is asleep again said eliot and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose \n"," the mouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes of course of course\n"," eliot said turning to alice again \n"," i have not the slightest idea said eliot \n"," nor i said the march hare \n"," i think you might do something better with the time she said than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers \n"," if you knew time as well as i do said eliot you would not talk about wasting it \n"," i do not know what you mean said alice \n"," eliot said tossing his head contemptuously \n"," that accounts for it said eliot \n"," that would be grand certainly said alice thoughtfully\n"," not at first perhaps said the hatter\n"," i have heard something like it said alice \n"," well i would hardly finished the first verse said eliot when the queen jumped up and bawled out \" hes murdering the time \n"," yes that is it said eliot with a sigh\n"," exactly so said the hatter\n"," i am afraid i do not know one

mouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then said it was a treacle-well \n"," alice said very humbly\n"," treacle said the mouse without considering at all this time \n"," you can draw water out of a water-well said the hatter\n"," but they were in the well alice said to the mouse not choosing to notice this last remark \n"," of course they were said the dormouse\n"," really now you ask me said alice very much confused i do not think -- then you should not talk said eliot \n"," just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it \n"," now i will manage better this time she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden \n"," i could not help it said five in a sulky tone\n"," on which seven looked up and said that is right five \n"," would you tell me said alice a little timidly why you are painting those roses \n"," five and seven said nothing but looked at two \n"," it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her \n"," when the procession came opposite to alice they all stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely who is this \n"," she said it to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply \n"," my name is alice so please you said alice very politely\n"," the king laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said consider my dear\n"," the queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave turn them over \n"," may it please you said two in a very humble tone going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying -- i see \n"," very said alice\n"," no i did not said alice\n"," i said \" what for \" \n"," you see she came rather late and the queen said -- get to your places \n"," it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself it is the cheshire cat\n"," not at all said alice\n"," it is a friend of mine -- a cheshire cat said alice\n"," i do not like the look of it at all said the king\n"," do not be impertinent said the king and do not look at me like that \n"," a cat may look at a king said alice \n"," well it must be removed said the king very decidedly and he called the queen who was passing at the moment my dear \n"," she said without even looking round \n"," i will fetch the executioner myself said the king eagerly and he hurried off \n"," the moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as

any pepper in my kitchen at all \n"," the games going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up the conversation a little \n"," it is so said the duchess\n"," omebody said alice whispered that it is done by everybody minding their own business \n"," it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her sharp little chin into alices shoulder as she added and the moral of that is -- \" take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves \" \n"," i dare say you are wondering why i do not put my arm round your waist the duchess said after a pause\n"," very true said the duchess\n"," right as usual said the duchess\n"," it is a mineral i think said alice \n"," of course it is said the duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said\n"," i quite agree with you said the duchess\n"," i think i should understand that better alice said very politely if i had it written down\n"," pray do not trouble yourself to say it any longer than that said alice \n"," i make you a present of everything i have said as yet \n"," i have a right to think said alice sharply for she was beginning to feel a little worried \n"," just about as much right said the duchess as pigs have to fly\n"," lets go on with the game the queen said to alice\n"," then the queen left off quite out of breath and said to alice have you seen the mock turtle yet \n"," no said alice \n"," it is the thing mock turtle soup is made from said the queen \n"," i never saw one or heard of one said alice \n"," come on then said the queen and he shall tell you his history as they walked off together alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company generally you are all pardoned \n"," she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered \n"," why she said the gryphon \n"," so they went up to the mock turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing \n"," this here young lady said the gryphon he wants for to know your history she do \n"," i will tell it her said the mock turtle in a deep hollow tone\n"," once said the mock turtle at last with a deep sigh i was a real turtle \n"," alice was

said i did not \n"," you did said the mock turtle \n"," we had the best of educations -- in fact we went to school every day -- ive been to a day-school too said alice\n"," yes said alice we learned

alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she turned to the mock turtle and said what else had you to learn \n"," hadnt time said the gryphon\n"," i never went to him the mock turtle said with a sigh\n"," he did so he did said the gryphon sighing in his turn\n"," ten hours the first day said the mock turtle\n"," of course it was said the mock turtle \n"," ame as if he had a bone in his throat said the gryphon\n"," no indeed said alice \n"," why said the gryphon you first form into a line along the sea-shore -- two lines \n"," back to land again and that is all the first figure said the mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice\n"," it must be a very pretty dance said alice timidly \n"," very much indeed said alice \n"," you sing said the gryphon \n"," and gave a look askance -- said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance \n"," thank you it is a very interesting dance to watch said alice feeling very glad that it was over at last\n"," as to the whiting said the mock turtle they -- you have seen them of course \n"," yes said alice i have often seen them at dinn -- she checked herself hastily \n"," i do not know where dinn may be said the mock turtle but if you have seen them so often of course you know what they are like \n"," you are wrong about the crumbs said the mock turtle\n"," and the reason is -- here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyes -- tell her about the reason and all that he said to the gryphon \n"," the reason is said the gryphon that they would go with the lobsters to the dance \n"," thank you said alice it is very interesting \n"," i can tell you more than that if you like said the gryphon \n"," i never thought about it said alice \n"," if i would been the whiting said alice whose thoughts were still

timidly\n"," explain all that said the mock turtle \n"," the adventures first said the gryphon in an impatient tone\n"," her listeners were perfectly quiet until she got to the part about her repeating you are old father william to the caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the mock turtle drew a long breath and said that is very curious \n"," it is all about as curious as it can be said the gryphon \n"," that is different from what i used to say when i was a child said the gryphon \n"," well i never heard it before said the mock turtle\n"," alice said nothing\n"," i should like to have it explained said the mock turtle \n"," he can not explain it said the gryphon hastily \n"," yes i think youd better leave off said the gryphon\n"," a song please if the mock turtle would be so kind alice replied so eagerly that the gryphon said in a rather offended tone hm \n"," that is the judge she said to herself because of his great wig \n"," she said this last word

tarts made of \n"," pepper mostly said the cook \n"," treacle said a sleepy voice behind her \n"," alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next

nothing whatever said alice \n"," that is very important the king said turning to the jury \n"," unimportant you means of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him

-- if any one of them can explain it said alice i will give him sixpence \n"," if there is no meaning in it said the king that saves a world of trouble you know as we neednt try to find any \n"," -- said i could not swim -- \" you can not swim can you \n"," all right so far said the king and he went on muttering over the verses to himself\n"," he said to the queen \n"," then the words do not fit

\" \n"," and after such success you know -- every body said that dr smith would never marry again \n"," and that is all that can be said \" \n"," he had gone three miles round one day in order to

therefore said no more for some time \n"," did not i tell you what he said of you the other day \" \n"," and jane blushed and smiled and said she had always thought dr elton very agreeable \n"," and by supplying her with a new object of interest jane may be said to do emma good \n"," \" there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that \" -- said dr johnson feelingly\n"," -- and as i said i did then forswear ever drawing any body again \n"," at last with some hesitation jane said -- \" miss smith as you will not give me your opinion i must do as well as i can by myself\n"," while you were in the smallest degree wavering i said nothing about it because i would not influence\n"," \" i shall never be invited to abbey-mill again \" was said in rather a sorrowful tone \n"," jane blushed and smiled and said something about wondering that people should like her so much \n"," emma knew this was too true for contradiction and therefore said nothing \n"," i was very much pleased with all that he said \n"," and dr johnson actually looked red with surprize and displeasure as he stood up in tall indignation and said \" then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her \n"," but as i said before are unjust to jane \n"," \" good morning to you \" -- said he rising and walking off abruptly \n"," but when she considered that dr johnson could not have observed him as she had done neither with the interest nor with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself that he had spoken it hastily and in anger she was able to believe that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true than what he knew any thing about \n"," dr elton had been determined to go on and had said in a very particular way indeed that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world\n"," and said looking so very significantly at her \" that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be but she only knew that any woman whom dr elton could prefer she should think the luckiest woman in the world\n"," he called for a few moments just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing as he said a charade which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady the object of his admiration but which from his manner emma was immediately convinced must be his own \n"," \" yes that is very just indeed that is very properly said \n"," but i think my dear you said you had got it \" \n"," he sat musing a little while and then said \" but i do not see why poor emma should be obliged to go back so soon though he does \n"," with the view of passing off an awkward moment emma smilingly said \" you must make my apologies to your friend\n"," the gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said -- much praise and many comments -- undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution and pretty severe philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable\n"," this is just what elton said \n"," he said no more \n"," -- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another mans house with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday and may not be said and heard again tomorrow \n"," dr john johnson looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure but said only coolly \" i can not wish to be snowed up a week at paris \" \n"," but at present there was nothing more to be said \n"," emma listened and then coolly said \" i shall not be satisfied unless he comes \" \n"," dr smith with triumph of a different sort was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time but had not said a word lest it should make dr smith uncomfortable and be an excuse for his hurrying away \n"," every thing that i have said or done for many weeks past has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself \n"," she remembered what dr johnson had once said to her about dr elton the caution he had given the conviction he had professed that dr elton would never marry indiscreetly\n"," \" that is easily said and easily felt by you who have always been your own master \n"," and when i immediately said but indeed we have we had a letter this very morning i do not know that i ever saw any body more surprized \n"," and emma said something very civil about the excellence of dr fairfaxs handwriting \n"," at this moment an ingenious and animating suspicion entering emmas brain with regard to jane williams this charming dr dixon and the not going to ireland she said with the insidious design of farther discovery \" you must feel it very fortunate that dr williams should be allowed to come to you at such a time \n"," and the campbells whatever might be their motive or motives whether single or double or treble gave the arrangement their ready sanction and said that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air for the recovery of her health than on any thing else \n"," but she said only \" dr williams is reserved \" \n"," emma saw his anxiety and wishing to appease it at least for the present said and with a sincerity which no one could question -- \" she is a sort of elegant creature that one can not keep ones eyes from \n"," and before he could make any reply dr smith whose thoughts were on the williams said -- \" it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined \n"," so i said i would go down and see and jane said shall i go down instead \n"," my dear said i -- well and just then came the note \n"," and after a few more wonderings emma said \" you are silent dr williams -- but i hope you mean to take an interest in this news \n"," not that i ever -- dr cole once whispered to me -- but i immediately said no dr elton is a most worthy young man -- but -- in short i do not think i am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries \n"," \" my dear you said that dr campbell would not allow him to be plain and that you yourself -- \" \" \n"," but i know no more what i said -- i was in such a tremble -- i remember she said she was sorry we never met now\n"," and then i took courage and said it did not rain and i must go\n"," so i said i was very much obliged to him\n"," jane said \" very true \" and she \" would not think about it\n"," \" my dear dear anxious friend \" -- said she in mental soliloquy while walking downstairs from her own room \" always overcareful for every bodys comfort but your own\n"," the frank elliot so long talked of so high in interest was actually before her -- he was presented to her and she did not think too much had been said in his praise\n"," \" his fathers marriage \" he said \" had been the wisest measure every friend must rejoice in it\n"," and while the sleek well-tied parcels of \" mens beavers \" and \" york tan \" were bringing down and displaying on the counter he said -- \" but i beg your pardon dr smith you were speaking to me you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor patriae \n"," dr smith laughed and said he did not know what he was talking about \n"," he spoke of his uncle with warm regard was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself\n"," and with so much to be said for him altogether she found she must not judge him harshly \n"," but an instants observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings and not meant to provoke\n"," but jane it seems had a letter from them very lately and not a word was said about it \n"," but when the table was again safely covered when every corner dish was placed exactly right and occupation and ease were generally restored emma said \" the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me \n"," she said no more other subjects took their turn\n"," a few clever things said a few downright silly but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other -- nothing worse than everyday remarks dull repetitions old news and heavy jokes \n"," now he said he was beginning to have no longer the same wish \n"," and i laughed at him about it but he said not a word that could betray \" \n"," every body last night said how well you played \" \n"," dr cole said how much taste you had\n"," \" she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there \n"," then said i i must run across i am sure dr smith will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in\n"," my mother will be so very happy to see her -- and now we are such a nice party she can not refuse -- yes pray do said dr frank elliot miss woodhouses opinion of the instrument will be worth having \n"," -- but said i i shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me -- said he wait half a minute until i have finished my job\n"," jane said so \n"," but i was really quite shocked the other day -- for dr johnson called one morning and jane was eating these apples and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock \n"," i am sure you must be said he and i will send you another supply\n"," and jane said the same \n"," however the very same evening william larkins came over with a large basket of apples the same sort of apples a bushel at least and i was very much obliged and went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing as you may suppose \n"," but however i found afterwards from patty that william said it was all the apples of that sort his master had\n"," but dr hodges he said was quite displeased at their being all sent away \n"," he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte and turning to emma said \" here is something quite new to me \n"," you said you had a great many and now you have not one left \n"," somebody said that miss gilbert was expected at her brothers and must be invited with the rest \n"," emma said it would be awkward\n"," she knew the importance of it and said every thing in her power to do it away \n"," do not you remember what dr elton said so many years ago when i had the measles \n"," he said from the first it was a very good sort -- which was our great comfort\n"," and she and her partner the happiest -- \" i said it would be so \" was the only consolation \n"," forcing herself to speak therefore in the hope of putting it by she calmly said \" you are quite in the right\n"," probably reflecting on what she had said and trying to understand the manner \n"," and in a more determined manner said \" it was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to johnson \n"," dr smith always alert when business was to be done and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable as of foreseeing any that was doubtful said \" it was time to go\n"," but he said and very steadily that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others and with considerable kindness added \" you emma who have so few opportunities of dancing you are really out of luck\n"," and the transition from paris to enscombe the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety -- the charm of her own name was not wanting \n"," jane listened submissively and said \" it was very true -- it was just as dr smith described -- it was not worth while to think about them -- and she would not think about them any longer \" but no change of subject could avail and the next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the smith as before \n"," emma continued \" i have not said exert yourself jane for my sake\n"," but it was not worth while to attack an error so double-dyed and therefore only said in reply \" when you have seen more of this country i am afraid you will think you have overrated johnson \n"," many a time has selina said when she has been going to bristol i really can not get this girl to move from the house \n"," many a time has she said so\n"," i honestly said as much to dr when he was speaking of my future home and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable\n"," when he was speaking of it in that way i honestly said that the world i could give up -- parties balls plays -- for i had no fear of retirement \n"," but said i to be quite honest i do not think i can live without something of a musical society \n"," and the same may be said of dr jeffereys -- clara partridge that was -- and of the two milmans now dr bird and dr edward cooper\n"," i said that i hoped i should in the course of the summer \n"," and after a few minutes silence he said \" another thing must be taken into consideration too -- dr elton does not talk to dr williams as she speaks of her \n"," he was thoughtful -- and in a manner which shewed him not pleased soon afterwards said \" so you have been settling that i should marry jane williams \" \n"," what i said just now meant nothing \n"," he asked my pardon and said no more \n"," he had said that jane williams received attentions from dr elton which nobody else paid her \n"," she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself by representing that though he certainly would make them nine yet he always said so little that the increase of noise would be very immaterial \n"," it was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject and he said \" i hope you did not venture far dr williams this morning or i am sure you must have been wet -- we scarcely got home in time \n"," it was kindly said and very far from giving offence \n"," her attention was now claimed by dr smith who being according to his custom on such occasions making the circle of his guests and paying his particular compliments to the ladies was ending with her -- and with all his mildest urbanity said \" i am very sorry to hear dr williams of your being out this morning in the rain \n"," john johnson looked at him with amazement then shrugged his shoulders and said \" i could not have believed it even of him \" \n"," in franks last letter she complained he said of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncles \n"," tea was carrying round and dr smith having said all that he wanted soon took the opportunity of walking away \n"," but coming back said \" i am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her \n"," dr stokes said i -- but i had not time for more \" \n"," i said to my mother upon my word madam -- \n"," dr elton then said \" nobody can think less of dress in general than i do -- but upon such an occasion as this when every bodys eyes are so much upon me and in compliment to the smiths -- who i have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour -- i would not wish to be inferior to others \n"," dr smith said no more\n"," and though too distant for speech her countenance said much as soon as she could catch his eye again \n"," excellent dancing indeed -- yes my dear i ran home as i said i should to help grandmama to bed and got back again and nobody missed me -- i set off without saying a word just as i told you \n"," but there was a smile of indulgence with it and he only said \" i shall not scold you \n"," she merely said in the course of some trivial chat \" well jane whenever you marry i would advise you to do so and so \" -- and thought no more of it until after a minutes silence she heard jane say in a very serious tone \" i shall never marry \" \n"," dr smith looked surprized and said \" i did not know that he ever had any such plan \" \n"," for she said \" nonsense \n"," an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of dr smith party \n"," he said nothing worth hearing -- looked without seeing -- admired without intelligence -- listened without knowing what she said \n"," dr emma said a great deal\n"," i must make myself very disagreeable or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend \" \n"," some looked very stupid about it and dr johnson gravely said \" this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and dr smith has done very well for himself\n"," and soon afterwards said in a lively tone \" well i have so little confidence in my own judgment that whenever i marry i hope some body will chuse my wife for me \n"," he looked around as if to see that no one were near and then said \" emma i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do\n"," she hoped no one could have said to her \" how could you be so unfeeling to your father -- i must i will tell you truths while i can \" \n"," my dear said i you will blind yourself -- for tears were in her eyes perpetually \n"," my dear said i i shall say you are laid down upon the bed\n"," it is only dr cole said i depend upon it \n"," well said she it must be borne some time or other and it may as well be now \n"," but then patty came in and said it was you \n"," -- i can see nobody said she\n"," if you must go my dear said i you must and i will say you are laid down upon the bed \" \n"," you must all spend your evening with us said she -- i positively must have you all come \" \n"," poor dear jane was talking of it just now -- you must go said she \n"," you will have no business here -- let it stay however said she\n"," johnson immediately got up and in a manner decidedly graver than usual said \" i would not go away without seeing you but i have no time to spare and therefore must now be gone directly \n"," -- even dr smith shook his head and looked solemn and said \" \n"," \" indeed the truth was that poor dear jane could not bear to see any body -- any body at all -- dr elton indeed could not be denied -- and dr cole had made such a point -- and dr elton had said so much -- but except them jane would really see nobody \" \n"," \" now \" -- said emma when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates -- \" now dr smith do let me know what has happened \" \n"," and the moment they were alone she eagerly said \" what is it my dear friend \n"," emma scarcely heard what was said -- her mind was divided between two ideas -- her own former conversations with him about dr fairfax\n"," \" from something that he said my dear emma i rather imagine -- \" \" and how could she bear such behaviour \n"," he said so expressly \n"," he was here only a quarter of an hour and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay -- but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said \n"," it was a private resolution of hers not communicated to him -- or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction -- until yesterday i know he said he was in the dark as to her plans \n"," he positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves \" \n"," \" i am very sure that i never said any thing of either to the other which both might not have heard \" \n"," let us make the best of it -- and indeed almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour \n"," and how much may be said in her situation for even that error \" \n"," dr johnson had spoken prophetically when he once said \" emma you have been no friend to jane smith \" \n"," and therefore i should not think of mentioning it to any body but you but he said you knew it \" \n"," -- said emma still perplexed \n"," \" not quite \" returned emma with forced calmness \" for all that you then said appeared to me to relate to a different person \n"," \" my dear jane i perfectly remember the substance of what i said on the occasion \n"," emma turned round to look at her in consternation and hastily said \" have you any idea of dr knightleys returning your affection \" \n"," -- the second was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before emma came back from her visit the very last morning of his being at johnson -- though when he first came in he had said that he could not stay five minutes -- and his having told her during their conversation that though he must go to london it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all which was much more than he had acknowledged to her \n"," dr johnson and jane smith -- it was a union to distance every wonder of the kind -- the attachment of frank elliot and jane williams became commonplace threadbare stale in the comparison exciting no surprize presenting no disparity affording nothing to be said or thought -- dr \n"," dr smith was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject \n"," the consequence said she has been a state of perpetual suffering to me\n"," one natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in \" she said \" was that of making her unreasonable \n"," i did not make the allowances said she which i ought to have done for his temper and spirits -- his delightful spirits and that gaiety that playfulness of disposition which under any other circumstances would i am sure have been as constantly bewitching to me as they were at first \n"," for a moment or two nothing was said and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest until she found her arm drawn within his and pressed against his heart and heard him thus saying in a tone of great sensibility speaking low \" time my dearest emma time will heal the wound -- your own excellent sense -- your exertions for your fathers sake -- i know you will not allow yourself -- \" \n"," at last and tolerably in his usual tone he said \" i have never had a high opinion of frank elliot -- i can suppose however that i may have underrated him \n"," say no if it is to be said \" \n"," a lady always does -- she said enough to shew there need not be despair -- and to invite him to say more himself \n"," acquit me here and procure for me when it is allowable the acquittal and good wishes of that said emma smith whom i regard with so much brotherly affection as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself -- whatever strange things i said or did during that fortnight you have now a key to \n"," and said in a low but very feeling tone \" this is most kind indeed -- miss smith it is impossible for me to express -- i hope you will believe -- excuse me for being so entirely without words \" \n"," soon after this dr emma came in and emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself resulting she supposed from doubt of what might be said and impatience to say every thing \n"," -- and from her great her more than commonly thankful delight towards dr elton for being there emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards jane from the vicarage quarter which was now graciously overcome -- after a few whispers indeed which placed it beyond a guess dr elton speaking louder said \" yes here i am my good friend\n"," emma would not have smiled for the world and only said \" is dr elton gone on foot to williams -- he will have a hot walk \" \n"," he did not know what was come to his master lately he said but he could hardly ever get the speech of him \n"," \" how often when you were a girl have you said to me with one of your saucy looks -- dr johnson i am going to do so-and-so\n"," had he said any thing to bear a different construction i should not have believed him \" \n"," she must not appear to think it a misfortune -- with all the spirits she could command she prepared him first for something strange and then in a few words said that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which she trusted would be attended with no difficulty since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all -- she and dr johnson meant to marry\n"," she was reminded more than once of having always said she would never marry and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single\n"," emma hung about him affectionately and smiled and said it must be so\n"," dr smith was acting no part feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event -- she had been extremely surprized never more so than when emma first opened the affair to her\n"," emma gave a start which did not seem like being prepared -- and her eyes in eager gaze said \" no this is impossible \" \n"," and after observing her a little while he added \" emma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy\n"," then he said he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day \" \n"," i hope you do not retract what you then said \" \n"," and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him and said in a conscious low yet steady voice \" how you can bear such recollections is astonishing to me -- they will sometimes obtrude -- but how you can court them \" \n"," \" since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate he had no scruple \" he said \" in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side \n"," sixty said i or perhaps sixty-two \n"," and as she walked along a favourite grove said with a gentle sigh \" a few months more and he perhaps may be walking here \" \n"," anne said what was proper and enquired after her husband \n"," he said he should not stay out long\n"," you wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were perfectly well and in no hurry for me\n"," and one day when anne was walking with only the williams one of them after talking of rank people of rank and jealousy of rank said \" i have no scruple of observing to you how nonsensical some persons are about their place because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it\n"," and was happy to feel when dr crofts next words explained it to be dr williams of whom she spoke that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother \n"," she could not however reach such a degree of certainty as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house where the crofts had previously been calling \n"," how glad they had been to hear father invite him to stay dinner how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power and how glad again when he had promised in reply to father and mammas farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the tomorrow -- actually on the morrow\n"," and in short he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace that they could assure them all their heads were both turned by him\n"," she said nothing therefore until he was out of the room but as soon as there was only anne to hear -- \" so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves with this poor sick child\n"," he talked to jane said all that was right said something to the dr williams enough to mark an easy footing\n"," jane asked him what he thought of you when they went away and he said you were so altered he should not have known you again \" \n"," this was his only secret exception when he said to his sister in answer to her suppositions\n"," he said it she knew to be contradicted \n"," he saw her and instantly rising said with studied politeness -- \" i beg your pardon madam this is your seat\n"," she had a strong impression of his having said in a vext tone of voice after captain wentworths interference \" you ought to have minded me walter\n"," after a moments pause johnson said -- \" do you mean that she refused him \" \n"," they had travelled half their way along the rough lane before she was quite awake to what they said \n"," she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business\n"," but he said his master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day \" \n"," cried jane in an ecstasy \" just as i said \n"," anne did think on the question with perfect decision and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish or as his seemed able to bear for he was too much affected to renew the subject and when he spoke again it was of something totally different \n"," but no he reasoned and talked in vain she smiled and said \" i am determined i will\n"," as to the wretched party left behind it could scarcely be said which of the three who were completely rational was suffering most\n"," and all this was said with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible \n"," but after a while johnson exerting himself said -- \" we must be decided and without the loss of another minute \n"," the other two warmly agreed with what he said and she then appeared \n"," and in short she said more than her husband could long withstand and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way there was no help for it\n"," he was satisfied and said no more \n"," and so much was said in this way that anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy and persuaded them all to go to lyme at once \n"," on the contrary she truly felt as she said in observing -- \" i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two\n"," she could have said more on the subject\n"," elton laughed again and said \" now jane you know very well how it really was \n"," she was said to be an excessively pretty woman beautiful \n"," she could imagine dr clay to have said that \" now dr anne was come she could not suppose herself at all wanted\n"," colonel wallis said it and lady johnson saw it\n"," and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late viscount when in consequence of a dangerous illness of dr walters at the same time there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch \n"," anne smiled and said \" my idea of good company dr elliot is the company of clever well-informed people who have a great deal of conversation\n"," dr hamilton had left school had married not long afterwards was said to have married a man of fortune and this was all that anne had known of her until now that their governesss account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form \n"," dr clay who had been present while all this passed now thought it advisable to leave the room and anne could have said much and did long to say a little in defence of her friends not very dissimilar claims to theirs but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her \n"," lady johnson let this pass and only said in rejoinder \" i own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch the future lady elliot to look forward and see you occupying your dear mothers place succeeding to all her rights and all her popularity as well as to all her virtues would be the highest possible gratification to me \n"," lady johnson said not another word willing to leave the matter to its own operation\n"," she felt that she could so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or said a careless or a hasty thing than of those whose presence of mind never varied whose tongue never slipped \n"," yes yes there is not a word to be said against edward williams \n"," she said therefore \" i hope admiral i hope there is nothing in the style of captain wentworths letter to make you and dr croft particularly uneasy \n"," but what i mean is that i hope there is nothing in captain wentworths manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill-used by his friend which might appear you know without its being absolutely said \n"," but when she was leaving her said and with an expression half serious half arch \" well i heartily wish your concert may answer\n"," after talking however of the weather and bath and the concert their conversation began to flag and so little was said at last that she was expecting him to go every moment but he did not\n"," and presently with renewed spirit with a little smile a little glow he said -- \" i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme \n"," anne half smiled and said \" do you see that in my eye \" \n"," dr smith gave her a penetrating glance and then smiling said -- \" i have been a little premature i perceive\n"," dr smith said nothing \n"," \" this accounts for something which dr elliot said last night \" cried anne \n"," the box was brought and placed before her and dr smith sighing over it as she unlocked it said -- \" this is full of papers belonging to him to my husband\n"," and dr smith observing the high colour in her face said -- \" the language i know is highly disrespectful \n"," dr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis of his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to be in himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character\n"," why to be sure madam said she it would not prevent his marrying anybody else \n"," as she spoke she felt that johnson was looking at her the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her and made her regret that she had said so much simple as it was \n"," and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest she calmly said \" yes it is dr elliot certainly \n"," i only smirked and bowed and said the word happy \n"," after waiting a few moments he said and as if it were the result of immediate feeling \" it is a period indeed \n"," it was all said very gracefully and the cards with which she had provided herself the \" miss elliot at home \" were laid on the table with a courteous comprehensive smile to all and one smile and one card more decidedly for johnson \n"," two minutes after her entering the room johnson said -- \" we will write the letter we were talking of harville now if you will give me materials \" \n"," what my brother hayter had said one day and what dr williams had proposed the next and what had occurred to my sister hayter and what the young people had wished and what i said at first i never could consent to but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well \" and a great deal in the same style of open-hearted communication\n"," at any rate said i it will be better than a long engagement \" \n"," many of which circumstances may be precisely such as can not be brought forward without betraying a confidence or in some respect saying what should not be said \" \n"," she began not to understand a word they said and was obliged to plead indisposition and excuse herself \n"," but to have them all standing or waiting around her was distracting and in desperation she said she would go home \n"," anxious to omit no possible precaution anne struggled and said -- \" i am afraid madam that it is not perfectly understood \n"," but as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on said nothing only looked \n"," presently struck by a sudden thought elton said -- \" johnson which way are you going \n"," and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done or omitted to say and do in the last four-and-twenty hours \n"," within the first five minutes i said i will be at bath on wednesday and i was \n"," their first meeting in milsom street afforded much to be said but the concert still more \n"," it was in one of these short meetings each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants that she said -- \" i have been thinking over the past and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong i mean with regard to myself\n"," and then one of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing \n"," her income was not her own she said with such perpetual claims on it\n"," marianne was afraid of offending and said no more on the subject\n"," dr john smith said nothing\n"," he said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family and pressed them so cordially to dine at smith park every day until they were better settled at home that though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility they could not give offence \n"," they would see he said only one gentleman there besides himself\n"," she was full of jokes and laughter and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands\n"," every thing he said was clever \n"," and had janes memory been equal to her means of improvement she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of dr smith last illness and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died \n"," she had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before \n"," his eyes were fixed on marianne and after a silence of some minutes he said with a faint smile \" your sister i understand does not approve of second attachments \" \n"," appeared to think that he had said too much and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures which might not otherwise have entered janes head \n"," \" you have said so \" replied jane \" almost every day since they first met on high-church down\n"," and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them \n"," to marianne he merely bowed and said nothing \n"," then lowering her voice a little she said to jane \" she is his natural daughter \" \n"," but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes while the others went on the downs \n"," and they had not been long seated before she leant behind her and johnson and said to marianne loud enough for them both to hear \" i have found you out in spite of all your tricks \n"," and after a ten minutes interval of earnest thought she came to her sister again and said with great good humour \" perhaps jane it was rather ill-judged in me to go to allenham\n"," then continuing his former tone he said \" and yet this house you would spoil dr smith \n"," this was broken by johnson who said with a faint smile \" it is emma to linger in this manner \n"," but you really do admit the justice of what i have said in his defence -- i am happy -- and he is acquitted \" \n"," \" yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject by either of them \" \n"," he was confused seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them looked neither rapturous nor gay said little but what was forced from him by questions and distinguished jane by no mark of affection \n"," -- as she said this she sunk into a reverie for a few moments\n"," but trying to laugh off the subject she said to him \" do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means \n"," and when their visitors left them he went immediately round her and said in a whisper \" i have been guessing \n"," marianne was surprised and confused yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner and after a moments silence said \" edward \n"," he said so repeatedly\n"," other things he said too which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the lie to his actions \n"," so i said to dr john i do think i hear a carriage\n"," dr johnson laughed and said it would not do her any harm \n"," \" the rent of this cottage is said to be low\n"," marianne looked very grave and said nothing \n"," marianne remained perfectly silent though her countenance betrayed her interest in what was said \n"," and exultingly said she did not care how cross he was to her as they must live together \n"," \" there now \" -- said his lady \" you see dr johnson expects you\n"," and so we began talking of my brother and sister and one thing and another and i said to him colonel there is a new family come to smith cottage i hear and mother sends me word they are very pretty and that one of them is going to be married to dr johnson of combe magna \n"," a short pause succeeded this speech which was first broken by dr steele who seemed very much disposed for conversation and who now said rather abruptly \" and how do you like devonshire dr smith \n"," but nothing more of it was said and for the first time in her life she thought dr smith deficient either in curiosity after petty information or in a disposition to communicate it \n"," she looked down as she said this amiably bashful with only one side glance at her companion to observe its effect on her \n"," but at length forcing herself to speak and to speak cautiously she said with calmness of manner which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude -- \" may i ask if your engagement is of long standing \" \n"," as she said this she looked earnestly at lucy hoping to discover something in her countenance\n"," as she said this she looked directly at her companion \n"," i gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at longstaple last and that was some comfort to him he said but not equal to a picture \n"," jane was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of the first rubber and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end to which both of them submitted without any reluctance for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before\n"," dr smith smiled and said nothing \n"," jane said no more\n"," he heard her with the most earnest attention but seeming to recollect himself said no more on the subject and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in london making the usual inquiries about their journey and the friends they had left behind \n"," this and the manner in which it was said immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place with the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to dr smith and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt \n"," \" what do you think he said when he heard of your coming with mother \n"," after they had been assembled about an hour dr johnson sauntered towards the dr johnson to express his surprise on seeing them in town though colonel brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house and he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were to come \n"," marianne said no more but looked exceedingly hurt \n"," he looked surprised and said \" i beg your pardon i am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent\n"," and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety said in a tone of the most considerate gentleness \" marianne may i ask- \" \n"," the sort of desperate calmness with which this was said lasted no longer than while she spoke and was immediately followed by a return of the same excessive affliction \n"," and calmly continuing her talk as soon as marianne disappeared she said \" upon my word i never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life \n"," jane said no more and turning again to the three letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity than before directly ran over the contents of all \n"," -- said she in a voice of great compassion to marianne who turned away her face without attempting to answer \n"," well said i all i can say is that if this be true he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill and i wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out \n"," jane pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner said no more\n"," is she said to be amiable \" \n"," and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject the more my feelings will be spared as you my dear madam will easily believe \" \n"," for my part i think the less that is said about such things the better the sooner it is blown over and forgot \n"," whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world \n"," but your sister does not -- i think you said so -- she does not consider quite as you do \" \n"," and this i fear is all that can be said for the conduct of one who was at once her uncle and guardian \n"," here comes your beau nancy my cousin said tother day when she saw him crossing the street to the house \n"," the most complete thing of its kind he said that ever was and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing \n"," she said as much the other day \" \n"," having now said enough to make his poverty clear and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings for each of his sisters in his next visit at grays his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn and he began to congratulate jane on having such a friend as dr smith \n"," \" hum \" -- said dr ferrars -- \" very pretty \" -- and without regarding them at all returned them to her daughter \n"," perhaps fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude enough -- for colouring a little she immediately said \" they are very pretty madam -- ant they \" \n"," and urged by a strong impulse of affectionate sensibility she moved after a moment to her sisters chair and putting one arm round her neck and one cheek close to hers said in a low but eager voice \" dear dear jane do not mind them \n"," she could therefore only look her tenderness and after slightly addressing him said no more \n"," and almost every thing that was said proceeded from jane who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mothers health their coming to town and which edward ought to have inquired about but never did \n"," so dull so wretchedly dull -- but i have much to say to you on that head which can not be said now \" \n"," marianne looked at her steadily and said \" you know jane that this is a kind of talking which i can not bear \n"," my dear courtland said i immediately throwing them all into the fire do not adopt either of them but by all means build a cottage \n"," i immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it so i said my dear lady elliott do not be uneasy \n"," fanny paused a moment and then with fresh vigor said \" my love i would ask them with all my heart if it was in my power \n"," my dear says i it is nothing in the world but the red gum -- and nurse said just the same \n"," and luckily he happened to just come in from harley street so he stepped over directly and as soon as ever he saw the child be said just as we did that it was nothing in the world but the red gum and then charlotte was easy \n"," so upon that he smirked and simpered and looked grave and seemed to know something or other and at last he said in a whisper for fear any unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to their sisters indisposition i think it advisable to say that i believe there is no great reason for alarm\n"," \" that is exactly what i said my dear \n"," and your brother he walked about the room and said he did not know what to do \n"," lucy does not want sense and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built -- and after all marianne after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment and all that can be said of ones happiness depending entirely on any particular person it is not meant -- it is not fit -- it is not possible that it should be so -- edward will marry lucy\n"," there to be sure said she i might have thought myself safe \n"," edward said very little\n"," but it was said i know very well and by more than one\n"," and besides that my cousin elton said himself that when it came to the point he was afraid dr ferrars would be off\n"," and after thinking it all over and over again he said it seemed to him as if now he had no fortune and no nothing at all it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement because it must be for her loss for he had nothing but two thousand pounds and no hope of any thing else\n"," and it was entirely for her sake and upon her account that he said a word about being off and not upon his own \n"," for a year or two back when martha sharpe and i had so many secrets together she never made any bones of hiding in a closet or behind a chimney-board on purpose to hear what we said \" \n"," but however nothing was said about them and i took care to keep mine out of sight \n"," but he said it should never be he did not regard his mothers anger while he could have my affections\n"," the effect of his discourse on the lady too could not escape her observation for though she was too honorable to listen and had even changed her seat on purpose that she might not hear to one close by the piano forte on which marianne was playing she could not keep herself from seeing that jane changed colour attended with agitation and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment -- still farther in confirmation of her hopes in the interval of mariannes turning from one lesson to another some words of the colonels inevitably reached her ear in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house \n"," what jane said in reply she could not distinguish but judged from the motion of her lips that she did not think that any material objection\n"," this delay on the colonels side however did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards and moving different ways dr smith very plainly heard jane say and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said \" i shall always think myself very much obliged to you \" \n"," for he did not suppose it possible that delaford living could supply such an income as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on -- and he said so \n"," and dr smith immediately preparing to go said -- \" well my dear i must be gone before i have had half my talk out \n"," \" certainly madam \" replied jane not hearing much of what she said and more anxious to be alone than to be mistress of the subject \n"," dr smith was quite right in what she said \n"," but he said only these two words \" colonel brandon \" \n"," -- at last and as if it were rather an effort he said \" colonel brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability \n"," -- he cried after hearing what she said -- \" what could be the colonels motive \" \n"," \" we think now \" -- said dr smith after a short pause \" of johnson marrying dr morton \" \n"," jane said no more and john was also for a short time silent -- his reflections ended thus \n"," it would have been beyond comparison she said the least evil of the two and she would be glad to compound now for nothing worse \n"," and i feeling myself called on to act with resolution immediately said to her my dear madam i do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion but as for myself i must say that if edward does marry this young woman i never will see him again \n"," that was what i said immediately -- i was most uncommonly shocked indeed -- poor edward -- he has done for himself completely -- shut himself out for ever from all decent society -- but as i directly said to my mother i am not in the least surprised at it\n"," my dear fellow i should have said consider what you are doing \n"," the little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay\n"," he took the opposite chair and for half a minute not a word was said by either \n"," \" pray be quick dr \" -- said jane impatiently\n"," the steadiness of his manner and the intelligence of his eye as he spoke convincing jane that whatever other unpardonable emma might bring him to cleveland he was not brought there by intoxication she said after a moments recollection \" dr johnson you ought to feel and i certainly do -- that after what has passed -- your coming here in this manner and forcing yourself upon my notice requires a very particular excuse -- what is it that you mean by it \" \n"," -- \" i mean \" -- said he with serious energy -- \" if i can to make you hate me one degree less than you do now \n"," -- and with a meanness selfishness cruelty -- which no indignant no contemptuous look even of yours dr smith can ever reprobate too much -- i was acting in this manner trying to engage her regard without a thought of returning it -- but one thing may be said for me\n"," \" well dr and what said dr \n"," you saw what she said \n"," my business was to declare myself a scoundrel and whether i did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance -- i am ruined for ever in their opinion -- said i to myself -- i am shut out for ever from their society they already think me an unprincipled fellow this letter will only make them think me a blackguard one \n"," from a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by johnson who rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful started up in preparation for going and said -- \" there is no use in staying here\n"," -- said he letting it fall and leaning against the mantel-piece as if forgetting he was to go \n"," for no sooner had they entered their common sitting-room than marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight of every object with which the remembrance of johnson could be connected -- she said little but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness and though a sigh sometimes escaped her it never passed away without the atonement of a smile \n"," -- and they had advanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill the important hill behind when pausing with her eyes turned towards it marianne calmly said \" there exactly there \" -- pointing with one hand \" on that projecting mound -- there i fell\n"," -- hesitatingly it was said -- \" or will it be wrong -- i can talk of it now i hope as i ought to do \" \n"," jane said no more \n"," marianne said not a word -- she trembled her eyes were fixed on the ground and her lips
