The man will sail the boat.                         The man will open the gate.  
The man will read the book.                         The beautiful birds catch fish in the river.
You can't live without food for very long.          But there were not enough boats for everyone. 
She may turn out the light.                         All the birds were beautiful. 
He didn't want birds in his kitchen.                She can lock the door. 

He went up on the top deck.                         I should hear the news on the radio. 
I've always wanted to be able to speak Japanese.    I can see her shadow through the wall. 
I have received a letter from my brother.           She spoke in a very loud voice. 
She opened the door and let me in.                  I wrote a letter to her about her future. 
I can hardly thank you enough for your kindness.    The ball hit the window and broke it. 

I hung my coat on the wall.                         Alice wore a white dress. 
They presented their idea to the captain.           We choose the right person to lead the group. 
It costs a lot of money to fit up a new office.     The ship was sailing to England. 
I have lived here since I was a student.            The boy doesn't like you very much either. 
The girl standing over there is my sister.          We lived in London for fifteen years. 

She wet her hands with water.                       She closed her eyes. 
She has visited there many times.                   After a while, she fell asleep. 
He took the salt out of the kitchen sink.           She wanted to see the news about the storm. 
He looked at the stranger with concern.             He turned the key in the lock. 
He returned from texas with his lovely new bride.   Goodness, I wonder if he knows. 

The weather is getting worse day by day.            He was walking down the street. 
These sailors showed great courage in the whaling.  She broke her leg in the fall. 
My friend threw the ball back over the fence.       We employed a lawyer to settle the trouble. 
He begged money in the streets.                     She stretched her arms out. 
She calls me crazy and stupid.                      She sailed the boat without any help. 


You may open your eyes.                             I am glad to see you again. 
I met you here last year.                           This is a picture he took. 
You have studied it for two years.                  It helped us complete the task. 
Congress is the largest division.                   He had a light breakfast and dinner. 
She tried to sleep, but she couldn't.               She is a pretty mistress. 

He swept all the pieces of food into the dust box.  He said it would rain a lot. 
Sorry, I thought you were someone else.             We saw a baby whale in the sea. 
I knew nothing of his business either.              We wish you were here with us. 
Green forest turns red in the autumn.               She read the letter more carefully the second time. 
She lived in England during the winter.             We followed the path along the river. 

They answered the strange question in turn.         He spent most of his life at home. 
I will send a message to you.                       He was reading a book. 
I've never played cards.                            He declared his love to her. 
But I'm telling the truth.                          She leaves her house in the morning every day. 
You must have suffered from a cold.                 It all sounds very interesting. 

We crossed the river in a boat.                     She nodded her head with ease. 
His voice sounded faint and far away.               The sea water swept over the deck. 
The man will turn the key.                          I have seen you before. 
It is difficult for me to speak English.            I always eat breakfast early in the morning to avoid the rush. 
I have an aunt who lives in Rome.                   This is a picture which he took yesterday. 

Just now I have finished my work.                   This picture shows people walking on the boat. 
Leaders come together to talk about plans for laws. I always drink tea with his breakfast. 
She opened her book.                                He put the penny on the table. 
The wind was starting to blow.                      He told people to stay home. 
People get less active as they get older.           The worst men often give the best advice. 


We all felt sorry for his death.                    Dr Smith brought a bottle of wine to the party. 
I suppose you're right.                             She cut the meat into small pieces. 
Anne suddenly appeared in the room.                 She didn't pay any attention to me at all. 
She carried her baby in her arms.                   His friends regard him as a man of the word. 
She drew a picture of me.                           The whaling ship came back to nantucket. 

He lives in a white house.                          I'm acquainted with that person. 
He helped me out with my task.                      He was always asking for money. 
I've been eating too much fish.                     He tied a rope around his neck. 
Every picture tells a story.                        We'll be staying at home at this moment. 
The ship sank to the bottom of the sea.             The man should pay the money.  


She hasn't read the book yet.                       The boys want you to come here. 
She did not eat anything until she was saved.       This is a ship that goes to London. 
The picture which she painted is beautiful.         The picture that he took is very good. 
English is spoken by many people in the world.      They build a house out of wood in the forest. 
The ship sink to the bottom of the sea.             Some people have more money than others. 

All of us ate fish for dinner.                      After a while, she fell asleep. 
He should sweep the floor because there is bread pieces.     Her car was in the street. 
We never know the worth of water until the well is dry.      He took care of his sick mother. 
I may find his lost dog.                            I haven't seen you for years. 
You can leave it to me.                             His dream has become a reality. 

She became extremely sad after her mother's death.  He started his own business last year. 
We were just talking about his new friend.          I paid the money for the present. 
She must place a cup on the table.                  He is writing a history of the town for students. 
I'm going to miss you very much.                    She could close the gate behind her. 
He cannot raise his arms above his head.            You should listen to the words of your mother. 


She drove the car into the narrow path.             He informed me about your late arrival. 
I should drive along the road.                      My sister won first prize for her singing. 
The hard weather could sink the ship.               We had sang a beautiful song together. 
You may close the door.                             I could cross the street.  
I was happy to meet you.                            The news made her happy so much. 

I'm sorry to be late.                               A great white sharks have a sharp sense of smell. 
She should tell me about his evil conduct.          I've never spoken ill of him in my life. 
She seated herself at her desk.                     The man may hear the noise.  
I told you to open the window.                      I have known him since I was a child. 
She has written a few books on whales.              It is the flower of her country. 

You shouldn't say things like that.                 I'm feeling a little sad this afternoon. 
It is dangerous to swim with sharks up close.       I doubt the truth of his words. 
You can't reach the mountain.                       You have studied English for two years. 
The bird spread its wings.                          I can try but I can't promise. 
The ship had many rooms for guests.                 All good things came to an end. 

Emma shook her head with tears.                     She burst into tears and ran from the kitchen. 
She shed tears at her wedding. ã€€
